# Moodle 4.5 Compatibility Updates

This document outlines all the changes made to ensure full compatibility with Moodle 4.5.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed External Library Includes
**Files Updated**: 
- `classes/external/update_label.php`
- `classes/external/find_labels.php`

**Change**: 
- **Before**: `require_once(\core\local\libdir . '/externallib.php');`
- **After**: `require_once($CFG->libdir . '/externallib.php');`

**Reason**: The previous path was incorrect for Moodle 4.5. The standard way to include external libraries is using `$CFG->libdir`.

### 2. Added Security Checks
**Files Updated**:
- `db/services.php`
- `db/access.php`

**Change**: Added `defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();` at the beginning of each file.

**Reason**: This security check is required for all Moodle plugin files to prevent direct access.

### 3. Enhanced Language Strings
**File Updated**: `lang/en/local_labeleditor.php`

**Changes**:
- Added `defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();` security check
- Added capability descriptions:
  - `$string['labeleditor:edit']`
  - `$string['labeleditor:view']`
- Added additional error and status strings for better user experience

**Reason**: Capability descriptions are required for proper Moodle administration interface display.

### 4. Added Privacy Provider
**File Created**: `classes/privacy/provider.php`

**Purpose**: Implements GDPR compliance by declaring that the plugin doesn't store personal data.

**Reason**: Privacy providers are mandatory for all Moodle 4.5 plugins to comply with data protection regulations.

### 5. Added Upgrade Script
**File Created**: `db/upgrade.php`

**Purpose**: Provides framework for future plugin version upgrades.

**Reason**: Best practice for Moodle plugins to handle version updates gracefully.

### 6. Removed Empty Install Script
**File Removed**: `db/install.php`

**Reason**: The file was empty but Moodle was looking for the `xmldb_local_labeleditor_install()` function. Since no installation steps are required, removing the file prevents the error.

### 6. Updated Documentation
**File Updated**: `README.md`

**Changes**:
- Updated to reflect Moodle 4.5 compatibility
- Added comprehensive installation instructions
- Included API usage examples
- Added troubleshooting section
- Included security considerations
